I am the Co-Founder and Head of AI at Annolive AI, where I lead AI strategy and development with a focus on building advanced NLP solutions. Previously, as a Data Scientist at Tiger Analytics, I specialized in developing advanced analytics solutions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industry. My expertise spans document chat systems with LLMs, text-matching, and document-parsing.

I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) from IIT Madras in 2020, with a specialization in Robotics and AI. During my time there, I worked on navigation of quadcopters in GPS-denied environments under the guidance of Prof. Ranjith Mohan. This research experience strengthened my foundation in complex problem-solving and algorithm development.

My professional journey also includes experience as a Solutions Engineer at Micron Technology, where I worked on semiconductor solutions and implemented technical solutions for memory products. This diverse background has equipped me with a unique perspective in approaching technical challenges.

I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI applications in business contexts and continuously exploring new developments in NLP and machine learning. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, R, and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects that leverage AI to solve real-world business challenges.
