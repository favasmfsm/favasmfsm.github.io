I am a Senior Data Analyst at Tiger Analytics with a deep passion for working with data and uncovering insights that drive business value. My current work is focused on natural language processing (NLP), specifically in the areas of text-matching and document-parsing. My experience in these sub-topics has enabled me to develop expertise in the application of NLP in real-world business scenarios.

I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) from IIT Madras. During my time there, I worked on indoor navigation of quadcopters under the guidance of Prof. Ranjith Mohan. This experience allowed me to hone my skills in programming languages such as Python, MATLAB, and C++.

Throughout my career, I have developed strong analytical skills and expertise in statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning. I am a self-motivated individual who is dedicated to finding solutions that add value to businesses. As an avid learner, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to solve complex business problems.
