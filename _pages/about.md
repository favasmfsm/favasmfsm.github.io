I am currently working as a Senior Data Analyst at Tiger Analytics. My works are broadly in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with special emphasis on sub-topics like text-matching and document-parsing.

I am deeply passionate about working with data and finding insights from it.

Previously, I received my Dual Degree(B.Tech+M.Tech) from IIT Madras, where I worked on indoor navigation for quadcopters with Prof. Ranjith Mohan.
